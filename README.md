`Leader Key` (`<leader>`): Is set to be `space`

## Installed plugins and configuration details 
- `Catpuccin` - This is the initial theme I used, but I grew to like gruvbox more, hence this is not used anymore.
- `Gruvbox` - This is the theme I'm currently using.
- `lsp-config` - This contains multiple configurations related to LSP's.
- `lualine` - When you open neovim, you will see an amazing status bar at the bottom thanks to this plugin.
- `neo-tree` - This is the plugin that gives the explorer or the file tree.
- `telescope` - Does multiple things, this is mainly a fuzzy finder, but this is being used for many things, highly customizable.
